# Brand Identity - Pórtico Reformas

> Positioning guidelines, tone of voice, and strategic communication

## 🎯 Manifesto: The Pórtico Way

At Pórtico, we believe a renovation isn't about tearing down walls—it's about rebuilding the stage where life happens.

> *"Most projects fail because they start with the construction, not with the people"*  
> — Júlio, Founder

We exist to reverse this logic. **Our focus is your routine; the space is the consequence.**

## 🏛️ Strategic Positioning

### What We Are
**Company specialized in Functional Transformation**

We're not "just another renovation company". We're specialists in reorganizing people's lives through space.

### What We Defend
-  **Applied intelligence:** Functional diagnosis before the first hammer strike
-  **Realistic planning:** Honest schedules, not optimistic ones
-  **Absolute respect:** Client's time and budget are sacred

### What We Fight Against
-  **Amateurism:** "Trusted handyman" that becomes a nightmare
-  **Quick fixes:** Shortcuts that create future problems
-  **Fake budgets:** "It'll be R$ 50k... Oops, now it's R$ 80k"
-  **Toxic stress:** Projects that sicken families

## 🎤 Tone of Voice: The Human Expert

### Temperature and Personality

Our communication balances **technical authority** with **emotional sensitivity**.

#### Intelligent, but Accessible
- **We do:** Explain the "why" it improves your routine
- **We avoid:** Empty jargon ("thermal expansion coefficient...")

#### Radically Transparent
- **We do:** Honest "no" when something doesn't make sense
- **We avoid:** Sales-y "yes" that becomes a problem later

#### Unhurried, but Assertive
- **We do:** Direct and complete answers
- **We avoid:** Corporate speak ("we'll be executing..."), beating around the bush

### Practical Examples

|  Avoid |  Use |
|----------|--------|
| "We'll execute the project according to optimized Gantt schedule" | "We deliver on time. If we're late, we pay a penalty" |
| "Our team will be guaranteeing finishing excellence" | "Every detail is checked twice. No rush, no mistakes" |
| "We offer customized end-to-end solutions" | "We plan your renovation thinking about how you live, not just aesthetics" |

## ✍️ Copywriting: Do's and Don'ts

###  Do

| Situation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Clear promise | "Guaranteed deadline in contract or you don't pay late penalty" |
| Contrast | "Most start with the wall. We start with your life." |
| Specificity | "20 years renovating homes in Porto Alegre" (not "vast experience") |
| Humanization | "Júlio always says: 'If it doesn't improve your routine, it's waste'" |

###  Avoid

| Situation |  Wrong |  Correct |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Jargon | "End-to-end full-service solutions" | "We handle everything from start to finish" |
| Corporate speak | "We'll be guaranteeing quality" | "We guarantee quality" |
| Vague | "Proven excellence" | "98% satisfaction in 200+ projects" |
| Technical mumbo-jumbo | "Class A ceramic coating" | "Floor that lasts 20 years without replacing" |
